# Gist Blog Engine

This is a Simple Headless blog app built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) alongside [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). 
Django is being chosen for this project because it is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 

Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

- The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
- Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
- Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
- Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
- Extensive documentation, and great community support.
- Used and trusted by internationally recognised companies including Mozilla, Red Hat, Heroku, and Eventbrite.
